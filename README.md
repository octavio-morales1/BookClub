# CS546group27
This is the final project for CS546. We are group 27. This github provides code for a site that would serve as a virtual gathering place for book enthusiasts, allowing them to discover new books, join or create book clubs, and engage in meaningful discussions with fellow readers. Created by Octavio Morales and Allan Joseph.

Note for Grader(s): The listed contributions are inaccurate. Octavio Morales and Allan Joseph used an extension called LiveShare on Vistual Studio Code, a method of Pair Programming for simultaneous changes to code on the hosts device. From there, the host can upate the github.
